<!--2019-01-16 BMT ebb: Check Plus!  Very impressive work on XML assignment 2!  We admire your use of attributes to make *explicit* the data that is *implicit* (or hidden/latent) in the letter. 
The hierarchy of the document allows the reader to track the letter's data very efficiently, as you'll see when we get to the XPath and data processing portion of the course! 

A suggestion for the <para> elements: You could either remonve the section attribute and replace it with an n='(n meaning number to give a numeric value to each paragraph)' to better organize the information.   Or you could change it to <para section"main" n"1"> and so on for the other two to better orgainze the information within the document.
Keep up the excellent work for future assignments!-->
